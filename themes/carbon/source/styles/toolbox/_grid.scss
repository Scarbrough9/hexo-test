CARBON GRID

Using the Grid

This is a very simple grid that uses media queries and Sass mixins to setup
a semantic grid that requries no markup classification. Simply `@include grid`
to the element you wish to use as your container. Apply column settings to
the elements within the container be using `@include column_span(num)`.

You can use media queries to alter column widths based on break points. You
can also set custom parameters in the `grid` mixin should you need an
instance of the grid that requires settings that differ from the global grid,
below are some examples of how that would look:

// Default usage might look like this
.carbon-grid {
    @include grid();

    &__block {
        @include column_span(6);

        @include mq(768px) {
            @include column_span(3);
        }
    }

    &__block-inner {
        background-color: rgba(blue, .3);
        padding: 1rem;
    }
}

// Custom usage would be like this
.custom-grid {
    @include grid(4px, 768px, 8);

    &__block {
        @include column_span(4, 768px, 8);

        @include mq(1024px) {
            @include column_span(2, 768px, 8);
        }
    }

    &__block-inner {
        background-color: rgba(blue, .3);
        padding: 1rem;
    }
}


Custom Settings

The default grid settings can be overwritten if you
choose to do so. You can either copy the variables
below and paste them in your project variables file,
or simply manage these variables in this file (above
the GRID: Default Settings line).

$grid_gutter: 1rem;
$grid_start: 480px;
$grid_columns: 12;

***/

// GRID: Default Settings
$grid_gutter: if(global-variable-exists('grid_gutter'), $grid_gutter, 1rem);
$grid_gutter_outer: if(global-variable-exists('grid_gutter_outer'), $grid_gutter_outer, true);
$grid_columns: if(global-variable-exists('grid_columns'), $grid_columns, 12);
$grid_columns_start: if(global-variable-exists('grid_start'), $grid_columns_start, 480px);

// GRID: Wrapper
@mixin grid(
    $this_grid_gutter: $grid_gutter,
    $this_grid_columns_start: $grid_columns_start,
    $this_grid_gutter_outer: $grid_gutter_outer
    ){
    padding: $this_grid_gutter/2;
    @include clear;

    @if $this_grid_gutter_outer {
        margin-left: -$this_grid_gutter/2;
        margin-right: -$this_grid_gutter/2;
        overflow: hidden;
        padding-left: 0;
        padding-right: 0;
    }

    & > * {
        padding: $this_grid_gutter/2;
        width: 100%;

        @include mq($this_grid_columns_start) {
            float: left;
            padding: $this_grid_gutter/2;
        }

        @include mq_range(0px, $this_grid_columns_start) {
            width: 100%!important;
        }
    }

    & + .grid {
        margin-top: -$this_grid_gutter/2;
        padding-top: 0!important;
    }

    .grid-block & {
        margin-top: -$this_grid_gutter/2;
        margin-bottom: -$this_grid_gutter/2;
        padding-top: 0!important;
        padding-bottom: 0!important;
    }
}

// GRID: Column Span
@mixin column_span(
    $columns,
    $this_grid_columns: $grid_columns
    ){
    $this_width: percentage($columns/$this_grid_columns);
    width: $this_width;
}
